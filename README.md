# Exploratory-Data-Analysis---Coursera
Exploratory Data Analysis Course Project Week 1

The data used in the plots is taken from the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository, and concerns the measurements of electric power consumption in one household with a one-minute sampling rate over a period of almost 4 years. Different electrical quantities and some sub-metering values are available. The data used is in the range from 2007-02-01 to 2007-02-02.

Four plots are constructed and saved to a PNG file, with a width of 480 pixels and a height of 480 pixels.
The first plot concerns the Global Activity Power, and it is a histogram that displays the frequency of the Global Active Power in kilowatts.
The second plot displays the Global Active power in kilowatts versus the usage days.
The third plot shows Energy sub metering versus the usage days.
The fourth one combines the second and third plot, and also displays the Voltage and the Global_reactive_power within the days of usage.
